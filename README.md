To initilize a project, run these in the cli;

    $ npm install
    $ npm start
    $ npm run sass
    $ tsc --watch

Note: This template provides quick start for 
    traditional web development process with
    flexibilty to implement any of the different
    frameworks such as Angular, React, or Vue
    after the initiation.
    
    As for Sass and Typescript, they're my
    personal preferences thus already been
    pre-installed.
